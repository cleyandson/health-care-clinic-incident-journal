Portfolio project developed as part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate">Google's Cybersecurity Course</a>

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository contains my completed "Incident Handler's Journal" for a simulated ransomware attack scenario on a healthcare clinic. This project is a key component of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focusing on the initial stages of incident documentation and analysis in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project demonstrates the ability to:
* Document a security incident clearly, concisely, and objectively.
* Apply the "5 W's" framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why) for initial incident investigation.
* Distinguish between an attack's root cause (vulnerability) and its motivation (goal).
* Structure incident notes to differentiate between immediate actions and long-term recommendations, aligning with standard incident response phases.

## 📜 Scenario Summary

The scenario involves a small healthcare clinic hit by a ransomware attack initiated via a targeted phishing email. The attack resulted in the encryption of critical patient data and a complete halt of business operations, requiring immediate and structured documentation to kickstart the incident response process.

## 📂 Project Files

The complete and formatted Incident Handler's Journal can be viewed in the PDF file below. The document details the incident according to the 5 W's framework and includes an analysis of immediate priorities and long-term recommendations.

## 🛠️ Concepts & Frameworks Applied

* **Incident Response Lifecycle:** Focus on the "Detection & Analysis" phase.
* **Incident Documentation:** Creation of a formal journal entry.
* **Threat Analysis:** Identification of ransomware tactics and phishing as the initial access vector.
* **Mitigation Strategy:** Formulation of both short-term (containment) and long-term (prevention) recommendations based on industry best practices.
